## Data Driven Visualization

This project is currently used as a test project for building a data
driven SVG infographic using CSS and R.

The idea for this process is as follows:

1.  Data will be supplied from various sensors at the lock. The data
    will include salinity readings.

2.  We will also get an SVG visual, and can attach id to sections of the
    graphic.

3.  R will process the data and sort it by time.

4.  We will iterate through the data and assign animation rules based on
    data values.

5.  Those animation rules (written in CSS) can be injected into the SVG
    definition (or written in external CSS file) and will animate in a
    webpage.
